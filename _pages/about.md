My name is Tayebeh. I'm German 🇩🇪. I am a software engineer and medical engineer, with a specialization in deep learning and advanced image processing solutions for industrial camera systems.

## 🚀 What I am working on Now
<p> I have been accepted into the Silicon Valley Fellowship program. In October, I plan to attend the fellowship in San Francisco.
<br>This fellowship has an acceptance rate of just 3% (1 in 20 out of an average of 700 global applicants), and selections are based on merit and personal achievements.
<br>The boot camp provides qualified fellows with access to a community of experienced alumni and mentors, networking events, and first-hand insights from Silicon Valley–based Big Tech professionals, investors, and top-tier tech entrepreneurs.

<br><br>Moreover, I am currently developing a prototype of a smart walking aid using computer vision and AI, leveraging my four years of experience as a software engineer and my background in computer vision and artificial intelligence.
<br>You can find the basic version of the walking aid in the following link: <a href="https://onurgulkokan6.wixsite.com/canebox" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">

</a>
<br>I have written more about it in the "Projects and Awards" tab.

<br><br>Besides my startup, I am working on publishing my paper and preparing for Azure 104 cloud exam.

<br><br>Last but not least, I’m preparing my application for a second master’s in Computer Science in USA, where I would get the opportunity to contribute to world-changing projects in AI in healthcare, in some of the top-notch labs in the world. While contributing to such labs, I would also have the chance to work on my startup and turn my ideas into reality and have a world-wide impact. <br><br>


## 🚀 What I am aiming at this fellowship
Since I am currently looking for co-founders and building up my team, I am looking for possible collaborators, especially experts from other fields, like MBA and finance.
I would like to connect with people in the startup world, meet investors, visit big tech companies, and experience the Valley’s ecosystem firsthand, understanding how things work there and how that compares to the startup ecosystem in Germany, and bring back new insights and connections both for myself and for the Innovate Hamburg community.

This fellowship would help me to extend my connections in Silicon Valley, get inspired by the mentors and founders who have gone this path.

Moreover, as I mentioned before, I am applying for a second master’s in San Francisco; therefore, the university tours would be a great opportunity for me to visit different labs. I would love to visit the Alaa Lab at UC Berkeley, BAIR Lab, MED AI Lab, and Clinical Neuroinformatics & AI Laboratory (CNAIL), if possible. It would help me decide which one fits me best.

Last but not least, I would like to bring back the knowledge I earn from this fellowship to our community "Innovate Hamburg".
This is how this fellowship can help me grow professionally and personally.<br><br>

## 🧠 More about my character and personality
Now that I became a self-taught software engineer by personal perseverance, I believe I can achieve anything by finding the right mentors and putting the effort into it. This fellowship would give me the oportunity to find the right mentors and increases my chances of success as an entrepreneur.

I have always been used to bringing people together to deliver value, even outside of tech. I remember encouraging Iranians at my university in Germany to set up a booth for Iran during the city’s culture night. I taught Iranian dancing to volunteers, and we danced on stage. I learned dancing back in Iran, where it was forbidden for women to dance in public. I believe in pushing boundaries, even if you were born within them.

In my opinion, being assertive, a self-learner, and thinking outside the box, which I see in myself, are the main characteristics of an entrepreneur. I moved to Germany, where I had no family or friends, despite being told I couldn’t go abroad because I had no relatives there. But I am writing to you now as a German by law.😊

I have tried many things in my life, from playing the violin to playing soccer and dancing since childhood. From studying medical engineering to working as a self-taught software engineer, I have constantly worked to improve my skills in coding and developing my ideas. As Steve Jobs once said about his calligraphy classes, all these skills came together at a time and made sense to him. So, in my opinion, we should do what we feel is ours to do. Now, with a background in medical engineering and software engineering, I can bring my ideas in healthcare technology into reality.

## 🌱 Beyond Tech
I love doing sports. I have tried different sports during my life. Right now I love to do weight lifting 🏋 and tennis 🎾. 
I love reading self-development books 📖.
I listen to podcasts about tech and self-development 🎧. Moreover, I attend a 2-year-long Transactional Analysis (TA) course which I believe it is necessary for every individual to enhance the soft skills for the career and personal life. 
Furthermore, I played violin 🎻 actively as a teenager and currently I am rekindling the passion and rebuilding techniques.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
