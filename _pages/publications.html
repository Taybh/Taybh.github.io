<p>
My first venture goes back to the time <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">when I was 16 years old</span>, when I worked on the project <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">“Making metal balls using terminal velocity “Fall in the liquid”</span>. My paper at that age was accepted and 
<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">published at 16th physics conference of Iranian students at Chamran University of Kerman</span>, and I received <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">the best paper award Issued by 9th School Network Conference.</span>


<br><br>At that time I was also <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">qualified for National Math Olympiad among all students in Tehran, Iran.</span>

<br><br>All these put a passion inside me for science and innovation.
That was when I got to know about biomedical engineering and the opportunity to <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">invent new technologies in healthcare</span>. I believe technology can save lives.

<br><br>That is why I chose biomedical engineering-bioelectric as my bachelor major.

<br><br>I could say <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">my next venture was immigration</span> from Iran to Germany in my early twenties. I wanted to work with state-of-the-art technologies and have the opportunities beyond where I was born to reach my goals and full potentials.

<br><br>During my master I got the passion for <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">AI in diagnosis in medicine</span> and I did multiple research assistances and internships in the field. One of my best projects is <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">My master’s thesis, where I applied deep learning techniques to improve the segmentation of brain structures for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.</span>

<br><br>In another project I developed and implemented self-supervised learning and transfer learning techniques to reduce the need for large labeled datasets in computer vision applications, especially in domains like medical imaging. In this project, I achieved 85% accuracy with only 2,000 labeled images (vs. 90% with 50,000 labeled images in classical supervised learning).

<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">My venture during my Master</span> was during a course called “Solution Design In Medical Engineering”, where my teammates and I received both the <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">“best design award” and “best team award”</span>. In this Project <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">we developed a smart walking aid for people with vision problem</span>, in which if the distance is less than 20 cm vibrator alarms the person. You could read more about the product in the following link: <a href="https://onurgulkokan6.wixsite.com/canebox" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">

</a>

<br><br>Back in 2018, the market did not have such a solution. 
Currently, with all the experience I have from computer vision and working as a software engineer for four years, currently I am developing a prototype of the walking aid using computer vision and AI.
